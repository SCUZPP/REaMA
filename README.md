# REaMA: Building Biomedical Relation Extraction Specialized Large Language Models Through Instruction Tuning


We introduce REaMA, a series of open-source LLMs with sizes of 7B and 13B specifically tailored for biomedical relation extraction tasks. REaMA is fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 series model. 


# Dataset
- The pre-processed training dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/stzpp/REaMA/blob/main/data.zip
- The test dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/stzpp/REaMA/blob/main/data.zip

# REaMA
- The fine-tuned REaMA 7B can be downloaded at git clone https://oauth2:qFCrieNkRxqEaNtsWWpN@www.modelscope.cn/zppqiwen/REaMA-7B.git
- The fine-tuned REaMA 13B can be downloaded at git clone https://oauth2:qFCrieNkRxqEaNtsWWpN@www.modelscope.cn/zppqiwen/REaMA-13B.git

# Requirements
- transformers>=4.31.0 
- torch>=2.1.0
- vllm>=054

# Usage

Reproduce the fine-tuned models
```python
bash train.sh
```

Reproduce the evaluation results
```python
bash test.sh
```


Start chatting with `REaMA` using the following code snippet:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

prompts = []
prompt = "<|user|>\n" + your_query + "\n<|assistant|>\n" 
prompts.append(prompt)
tp_size = 4   
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, max_tokens=1024, stop = ["\nInput", "USER:", "USER", "ASSISTANT:", "ASSISTANT"])
llm = LLM(model=model_name, trust_remote_code=True, gpu_memory_utilization=0.8, tensor_parallel_size=tp_size)
outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
generated_text = [output.outputs[0].text for output in outputs]
outputs = generated_text[:]

print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

REaMA should be used with this prompt format:
```
### User:
Your query here

### Assistant
The output of REaMA
```
